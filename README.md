# bash-utils

Bash libraries for:
* ASCII character functions (chr and ord),
* array handling,
* getting user input passwords into variables,
* logging,
* processing command line options,
* remote command execution with no password requisition and
* menus (bash select with letters instead of numbers).

This is the list up to the moment.
